Overview
--------
The Smart-Pointers library tracks references to program resources and automates
the freeing of those resources if and only if the reference count drops to zero.
Most commonly, the reference is a pointer and the resource is memory.  In that
context, Smart-Pointers help to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers, which
commonly causes programs to crash due to memory limitations or segmentation faults, 
respectively.

To use Smart-Pointers, define a non-abstract derived type that 

1. Extends Smart Pointer's `sp_smart_pointer_t` type,
2. Implements the inherited `free` deferred binding, and
3. Invokes the inherited `start_count` procedure inside object constructors.

You can then use intrinsic assignments to copy instances of a `sp_smart_pointer_t`
child type, resulting in a [shallow copy] with the advantage that the target
will be finalized only when it becomes safe to do so.  

Example
-------
See the [example](./example) folder for a demonstration of the use of Smart-Pointers.

Background
----------

For more background on the design philosophy and the internal mechanics of Smart
Pointers, see Rouson et al. (see [[1]], [[2]], [[3]]).  This repository's code
originated from refactoring the code in those publications to use more up-to-date
coding conventions.  For example, this repository separates interface bodies
into modules and procedure definitions into submodules.  This repository also
uses more descriptive nomenclature for the types and procedures.

This repository also adds
1. A [Fortran Package Manager] build system,
2. Tests based on the [Veggies] unit-testing framework,
3. Documentation generated by [`ford`] and deployed to the web via GitHub Actions, and
4. Quality control via continuous integration testing using GitHub Actions.

Supported Compilers
-------------------
Correct execution of the Smart Pointers library depends critically on comprehensive
compiler support for type finalization.  The unit test suite verifies the relevant
compiler standard-conformance, including a test for each scenario in which the
the Fortran 2018 standard requires that an object be finalized.  The table below
summarizes the observed compiler behaviors:

| _Compiler_   | _Test failures_    | _Version tested_                                    |
| :---         |       :---:        | :---                                                |
| AMD          | N.A. (see Note 1.) | `flang` 13.0.0 (AOCC_3.2.0-Build\#128 2021\_11\_12) |
| Cray         | >= 3 (see Note 3.) | `ftn` 13.0.1                                        |
| GCC          |         6          | `gfortran` 12.2.0                                   |
| IBM          |         1          | `xlf2008_r` 17.1.0 on AIX                           |
| Intel        |         1          | `ifort` 2021.7.0 Build 20220726_000000              |
| LLVM         | N.A. (see Note 2.) | `git` commit `f5253058144aca1e9fcacd` (9/20/2022)   
| NAG :trophy: |         0          | `nagfor` 7.1 Build 7113                             |
| NVIDIA       |         2          | `nvfortran` 22.7-0                                  |

**Notes**
1. Fails to build due to an internal compiler error (ICE).
2. Fails to build due to type finalization not yet being supported.
2. Fails to build due to `fpm` issue [767]. See [test/README.md#cray] for a lower bound on the Cray compiler test failures.

See the [test suite README.md](./test/README.md) for more details on each compiler's test
results.
